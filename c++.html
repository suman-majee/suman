<h1>c++ learning</h1>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. It is an extension of the C programming language and supports object-oriented programming, as well as generic programming features. C++ is widely used in the development of operating systems, game engines, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.</p>


Some key features of C++ include:
<ol>
   <li>Object-oriented programming: C++ supports the encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism features of object-oriented programming.
</li>
<li>Templates: C++ templates enable the creation of generic data types and functions, which can work with different data types.
</li>
<li>Standard Library: C++ provides a rich Standard Library that includes containers, algorithms, and other utilities.</li>
<li>Memory Management: C++ gives the programmer control over memory management, which can lead to better performance in certain situations.</li>
<li>Performance: C++ is known for its performance, due to its efficient use of resources and direct access to system hardware.</li>
</ol>
